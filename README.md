Exploring practices for sustainable (small) data science

## Initiation phase

### Project structure

1. [Cookiecutter template](https://drivendata.github.io/cookiecutter-data-science/)
2. My own project structure (provide examples)
    1. Data, notebooks, scripts, outputs
3. Separate data work from scholarly articles
    1. Usual published project structure:
        1. Versioned code repository with DOI (Github + Zenodo)
        1. Versioned data repository with DOI (Dataverse)
        1. Versioned repository with code/data to reproduce article (Github + Zenodo)

## Ongoing phase

### Utility
9. Progress bars: [tqdm](https://tqdm.github.io/)
10. APIs: [Postman](https://www.postman.com/)

## Development

3. Dependency management: [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/), [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv), [pipx](https://github.com/pypa/pipx)
6. Leverage notebooks and interactive development environments
    5. I can provide a deep dive into my local dev setup. But maybe not relevant for non-pythonistas
7. Serious development in notebooks: [nbdev](https://nbdev.fast.ai/)

## Research process
8. Github Wiki as a research log

### Completion phase

## Collaboration
11. Turn notebooks into slides: [RISE](https://rise.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)
12. [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/)
